# Solana AI Hackathon Submission

## Project Overview

We are excited to present our project for the [Solana AI Hackathon](https://www.solanaaihackathon.com/), which focuses on revolutionizing AI data training using Web3 principles. Our project leverages decentralized AI training and data validation, driven by the power of DAOs and tokenized incentives, to foster a more inclusive and community-driven AI ecosystem. 

By using Telegram and World Miniapps, we enable seamless participation in the AI training process, allowing users to contribute data, label, and validate AI models while earning rewards. This decentralized approach ensures the highest quality, diversity, and transparency in AI training, solving key problems in current centralized data models.

## Key Features:
- **AI Training DAO Framework**: Specialized DAOs for different sectors such as healthcare, autonomous driving, and finance.
- **Crowdsourced Data Labeling**: A global community contributing to data accuracy and transparency.
- **Borrow + Bonding Curve Model**: Borrowing DAO tokens instead of purchasing, creating liquidity naturally.
- **Governance via DAO Tokens**: Tokenized governance to empower the community in decision-making.
- **Liquidity Pools and External AMM Pools**: DAO tokens can be traded, short-sold, and used in liquidity pools.
